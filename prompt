We are creating voter system using mern . I need backend code . description as , Home page is same for Voter and Admin . There should be 3 pages on landing page. When user click on voter , he will redirected to login (without jwt) and after login he will able to vote and after voting he will simply redirected to home page where voter and admin login exist . Now when Admin login , he will redirected to admin login page , then there are two options , Add voter and dashboard . Add voter means voter is generated . And dashboard means voting status visible . I need models and routes . I already created app.js and index.js .
